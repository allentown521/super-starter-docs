All API endpoints and their resolvers are defined in the `apps/api/` package. Here you will find a routes folder that contains the different feature modules of the API. Each module has its own folder and exports all its resolvers. 

## Create new module

To create a new module, simply create a new folder in the `apps/api/app/server/api/routes` directory. For example, if you want to create a new module called `hello`, you would create a new folder called `hello` in the `apps/api/app/server/api/routes` directory.

```ts apps/api/app/server/api/routes/hello/index.ts
// apps/api/app/routes/auth.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();

const hello = app.basePath('/hello').get('/', (c) => {
  const { name } = c.req.query();
  return c.json({ message: `Hello ${name || 'World'}!` });
});

// export type AppType = typeof hello;
// export const GET = handle(app);
// export const POST = handle(app);
export default hello;
```

## Register router

We create a separate Hono route in the `apps/api/app/server/api/index.ts` file and aggregate all sub-routers into one main router. To make the module and its endpoints available in the API you need to register a router for this module in the index.ts file:

```ts apps/api/app/server/api/index.ts
import hello from './routes/hello';


const routes = app.route('/', books);
```

That's it! You've just created a new API endpoint - it's now available at /api/hello ðŸŽ‰
