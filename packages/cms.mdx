[Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.com/) is a markdown-based CMS that helps you manage your content in a structured way within your codebase. We use it to manage the content of the `blog`, `documentation` and other `content pages` (like the `legal pages`) with MDX.

## How to write content?

All content is in the `apps/web/content` directory, and the content is divided into three sub directories: `blog`, `docs` and `legal`.

You only need to create new MDX files in the corresponding directory, and Fumadocs will automatically scan these files and generate the corresponding pages.

<Tip>
If you don't want to know too much technical details, you can skip the following section directly. 

You only need to refer to the example mdx file in the directory to write new content, it is very simple
</Tip>

## How to monetize Adsense?

If you want to add google ads to your document, follow these steps:

1. Add your google ad ID to the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADS_PUB_ID`
2. Add the `<Adsense />` tag to the location where the article wants the ad to appear

## What is a Content Source?

The input/source of your content, it can be a CMS, or local data layers like **Content Collections** and **Fumadocs MDX** (the official content source).

Fumadocs is designed carefully to allow a custom content source, there's also examples for [Sanity](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs-sanity) if you are interested.

<Note>`lib/source.ts` is where you organize code for content sources.</Note>

## Layout Styles

You can open `app/layout.config.tsx`, it contains the shared options for layouts.
Fumadocs offer a default **Docs Layout** for documentation pages, and **Home Layout** for other pages.

You can customise the layouts in `layout.tsx`.

## Search

`app/api/search/route.ts` contains the Route Handler for search, it is powered by [Orama](https://orama.com) by default.

## Navigation Links

Navigation links are passed to layouts, you can also customise them in your Layout config.

```tsx app/layout.config.tsx
import { BookIcon } from 'lucide-react';
import type { BaseLayoutProps } from 'fumadocs-ui/layouts/shared';
 
export const baseOptions: BaseLayoutProps = {
  links: [
    {
      icon: <BookIcon />,
      text: 'Blog',
      url: '/blog',
    },
  ],
};
```
