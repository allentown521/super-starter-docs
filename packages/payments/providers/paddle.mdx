[Paddle Billing](https://www.paddle.com/) is a merchant of record for selling digital products and subscriptions. It takes care of payments, global tax compliance, fraud prevention, localization, and subscriptions. Hereâ€™s how to switch the default payment processor from Stripe to Paddle Billing.

## Get the api key

After you have created your account for Creem, you will need to get the API key. You can do this by going to the [API page](https://www.paddle.com/) in the dashboard. Here you will find the Secret key and the Publishable key. You will need the Secret key for the integration to work.

Add environment variables

To use the Creem integration, you need to define the following environment variables to your .env.local as well as your production environment:

```env .env.local
PADDLE_SECRET_KEY=
PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
PADDLE_ENV="" // Use 'sandbox' if you're using the sandbox environment - else use 'production' or omit the parameter
```

### Creating a Checkout Session

We need to create a checkout session to charge your users , and you only need modify some code. It consists of two parts:

- Client

It sends a request to create a session to the `/api/paddle/checkout` endpoint.

```tsx apps/web/[locale]/components/payment/price-form.tsx
      const response = await fetch('/api/paddle/checkout', { // change to `/api/paddle/checkout`
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
          priceId: item.priceId,
          interval: item.interval,
        }),
      });
```

- Server

<Tip>
If you want create a checkout session in client side, you can use the following code:

```tsx apps/web/[locale]/components/payment/price-form.tsx
'use client';

import { usePaddle } from '@repo/payments/checkout';

const Pricing = () => {
  const paddle = usePaddle();

  function openCheckout(priceId: string) {
    paddle?.Checkout.open({
      items: [
        {
          priceId,
          quantity: 1,
        },
      ],
    });
  }

  return (
    <Button
      className="mt-8 gap-4"
      onClick={() => openCheckout('pri_01jkzb4x1hc91s8w38cr3m86yy')}
    >
      Subscribe now <MoveRight className="h-4 w-4" />
    </Button>
  );
};

export default Pricing;
```
