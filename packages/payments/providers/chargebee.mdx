## Get the api key

After you have created your account for Creem, you will need to get the API key. You can do this by going to the [API page](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/api_keys.html) in the dashboard. Here you will find the Secret key and the Publishable key. You will need the Secret key for the integration to work.

### Add environment variables

To use the Creem integration, you need to define the following environment variables to your .env.local as well as your production environment:

```env .env.local
CHARGEBEE_API_KEY=
CHARGEBEE_SITE=
CREEM_API_KEY=""
```

export * from './providers/chargebee';

### Creating a Checkout Session

We need to create a checkout session to charge your users , and you only need modify some code. It consists of two parts:

- Client

It sends a request to create a session to the `/api/chargebee/checkout` endpoint.

```tsx apps/web/[locale]/components/payment/price-form.tsx
      const response = await fetch('/api/chargebee/checkout', { // change to `/api/chargebee/checkout`
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
          priceId: item.priceId,
          interval: item.interval,
        }),
      });
```

- Server
