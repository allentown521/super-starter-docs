ShipThing comes with a generic payments module that enables you to charge your users 

## Providers

In the `@repo/payments` package in your repository you can find the `providers` folder.

There are multiple providers available:

</CardGroup>

## Local development

The way to test the webhook during local development

<Tip>
This way is universal to all providers. Stripe provides its own CLI to better handle local development. We will introduce it in detail in the Stripe chapter.
</Tip>

### Tunnel

If you want to test the webhook locally, you can use [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to create a tunnel to your local machine. Ngrok will then give you a URL that you can use to test the webhook locally.

To do so, install ngrok and run it with the following command (while your ShipThing web development server is running):

```bash
ngrok http 3002
```
<Note>
We forward webhooks to port 3002 of `apps/api` by default. If your web development server is not port 3002, please modify the port in the ngrok command.
</Note>

This will give you a URL (see the Forwarding output) that you can use to create a webhook in Stripe. Just use that url and add `/api/webhooks/{providerName}` to it. Replace `{providerName}` with the name of the provider you are using. For example, if you are using Stripe, you would use `stripe` as the provider name.

## Production development

When going to production, you will need to set the webhook URL and the events you want to listen to in payment provider.

If the webhook path is `/api/webhooks/stripe` and your app is hosted at `https://myapp.com` then you need to enter `https://myapp.com/api/webhooks/stripe` as the URL.
