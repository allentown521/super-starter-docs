The billing configuration schema replicates your billing provider's schema, so that:

- we can display the data in the UI (pricing table, billing section, etc.)
- create the correct checkout session
- make some features work correctly - such as feature-based access

It is common to all billing providers and placed in `apps/web/config.ts`. We can see the schema in the `packages/design-system/types/pricing.d.ts` package. Let me show you some important parts:

## Billing model

```ts
export type PaymentType = 'one-time' | 'month' | 'year';
```
This is the billing model of your product. It can be one of the following:

- `one-time`: The product is one-time purchase.
- `month`: The product is subscription-based and renews monthly.
- `year`: The product is subscription-based and renews yearly.

## Prices

```ts
export interface PricingItem {
  title: string;
  price: number;
  priceId: string;
  description?: string;
  featuresTitle?: string;
  actionTitle?: string;
  features?: Feature[];
  interval: PaymentType;
  isPopular?: boolean;
  badge?: BadgeProps;
  group?: string;
  credits?: number;
  originalAmount?: number;
  validMonths?: number;
  amount?: number;
  onMmount?: number;
  attribute?: Record<string, unknown>; // your custom data
}
```

`priceId` is the ID of the price in your billing provider. It is used to create the checkout session and to display the correct price in the UI.

<Tip>
`priceId` from the provider (e.g. Stripe) or `variantId` (e.g. Lemon Squeezy) , some providers use `productId` instead of `priceId`. Just use `priceId` to store it.
