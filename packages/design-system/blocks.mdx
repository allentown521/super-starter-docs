## What are Blocks?
`Blocks` refers to a reusable component or module in a design system. They are built on CSS variables and styles provided by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to quickly create a consistent and beautiful UI in your application.


## What is the difference between Blocks and components?

`Blocks` is a collection of higher-order componentsï¼Œincluding:

`header` , `footer` , `hero` , `features` , `subscribe`, `waitlist`, `faq` , `pricing` , `testimonials` , `cta` , `usage`, `login`, `brand` and `contact`

Components are components of Blocks, they are the smallest units of Blocks, used to build Blocks.

## How to use Blocks?

The data of `Blocks` is configured through [`config.ts`](/setup/configuration/app-config), and you only need to introduce Blocks where you need it, such as our Landing Page:

```tsx hero.tsx
const Home = async ({ params }: HomeProps) => {
  const { locale } = await params;
  const dictionary = await getDictionary(locale);

  return (
    <>
      <Hero data={heroData(dictionary)} />
      <Brand data={brandData(dictionary)} />
      <ShowCase data={showCaseData(dictionary)} />
      <FeatureRows data={featureData(dictionary)} />
      <Stats data={statsData(dictionary)} />
      <Testimonials data={testimonialData(dictionary)} />
      <PriceForm data={priceData(dictionary)} />
      <FAQ data={faqData(dictionary)} />
      <WaitlistForm data={waitlistData(dictionary)} />
      <SubscribeForm data={subscribeData(dictionary)} />
      <CTA data={ctaData(dictionary)} />
    </>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

<Tip>
  `Blocks` can help you build applications quickly. We are constantly building new `Blocks`, you can modify them according to your needs, or create your own `Blocks`.
