description: How to configure your development environment for SuperStarter.
---

Before you can get started, you will need to have the following installed on your machine.
在开始之前，您需要在计算机上安装以下内容。

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v20 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended, or any other code editor)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

SuperStarter defaults to using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as a package manager, but you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) instead by passing a flag during the [installation](/setup/installation) step.


## Stripe CLI

We use the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) to forward [payments webhooks](/packages/payments#webhooks) to your local machine.

<Note>The Stripe CLI is optional, but it is recommended to use it to test your payments integration if you use Stripe as your payment processor.</Note>

Once installed, you can login to authenticate with your Stripe account.

```sh Terminal
stripe login
```

## Accounts

SuperStarter relies on various SaaS products. You will need to create accounts with the following services then set the API keys in your [environment variables](/env):

<Note>Don't worry, you don't need to use all the services. We will guide you on how to configure it on demand during the [installation](/setup/installation) step.</Note>
