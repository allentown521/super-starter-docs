Advanced topic

This is an advanced topic - you should only follow these instructions if you are sure you want to add a new package to your ShipThing application instead of adding a folder to your application in apps/web or modify existing packages under packages. You don't need to do this to add a new page or component to your application.
</Warning>

## Generate a new package
Enter the command below in the root directory to create a new package:

```sh Terminal
npx turbo gen init
```

## Use the package in your application

You can now use the package in your application by importing it using the package name:

```tsx apps/web/app/page.tsx
import { example } from "@repo/example";
 
console.log(example());
```
