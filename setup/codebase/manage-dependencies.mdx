## Install dependencies

To install a package you need to decide whether you want to install it to the root of the monorepo or to a specific workspace. Installing it to the root makes it available to all packages, while installing it to a specific workspace makes it available only to that workspace.

- To install a package globally, run:

```sh Terminal
pnpm add -w <package-name>
```

- To install a package to a specific workspace, run:

```sh Terminal
pnpm add --filter <workspace-name> <package-name>
```

Or go to the folder where you want to install the package and run:

```sh Terminal
pnpm add <package-name>
```

## Remove dependencies

Removing a package is the same as installing but with the `remove` command.

- To install a package globally, run:

```sh Terminal
pnpm remove -w <package-name>
```

- To install a package to a specific workspace, run:

```sh Terminal
pnpm remove --filter <workspace-name> <package-name>
```

## Upgrading dependencies

You can upgrade all the dependencies in all your `package.json` files and installs the new versions with the `bump-deps` command:

```sh Terminal
pnpm bump-deps
```

This will update all the dependencies in your `package.json` files and install the new versions.

<Tip>You should run a `pnpm build` after running `bump-deps` to ensure the project builds correctly. You should also run `pnpm dev` and ensure the project runs correctly in runtime.</Tip>

## Upgrading shadcn/ui components

You can upgrade all the shadcn/ui components in the [Design System](/packages/design-system/components) package with the `bump-ui` command:

```sh Terminal
pnpm bump-ui
```

This will update all the shadcn/ui components, as well as the relevant dependencies in the Design System's `package.json` file.

<Warning>This will override all customization you've made to the components folder `@repo/design-system/components`. To avoid this happening, we recommend not to modify the code directly. If the shadcn components not satisfies your need , build your own instead of changing the shadcn components.</Warning>

<Warning>The `shadcn` CLI will likely make some unwanted changes to your shared Tailwind config file and global CSS. Make sure you review changes before committing them.</Warning>
