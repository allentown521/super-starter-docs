## Environment variables

If you're deploying on Vercel, we recommend making use of the [Team Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#team-environment-variables) feature. 

## Integrations

We also recommend installing the [BetterStack](https://vercel.com/integrations/betterstack) and [Sentry](https://vercel.com/integrations/sentry) integrations. This will take care of the relevant [environment variables](/env).
