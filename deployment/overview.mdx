description: Learn how to deploy your ShipThing application.
---

In general you can deploy the application to any hosting provider that supports Node.js. In this documentation we cover multiple deployment targets from serverless platforms like Vercel to self-hosted solutions with Docker.

Since Next.js is a framework built by Vercel, you will get the best developer experience when deploying to Vercel.

## Project setting

To deploy ShipThing on any hosting provider, you need to create 3 new projects for the `app`, `api` and `web` apps. After selecting your repository, change the Root Directory option to the app of choice e.g. `apps/app`. This should automatically detect the Next.js setup and as such, the build command and output directory.

Then, add all your environment variables to the project.

Finally, just hit "Deploy" and Vercel will take care of the rest!

<Note>
Here we assume that you already know the differences between these applications and which ones you will deploy
</Note>

## Environment variables

We recommend making use of the Team Environment Variables feature of the hosting provider before deploying. Variables used by libraries need to exist in all packages and duplicating them can be a headache. Learn more about how [environment variables](/env) work in ShipThing.

<Note>
First deployment may fail

The first time this may fail if you don't place all the environment variables correctly. It's fine. Make the first deployment fail, then correct the environment variables. Redeploy.
