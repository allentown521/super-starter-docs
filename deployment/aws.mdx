In this guide we will show you how to easily deploy your SuperStarter SaaS with [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

Before we start, make sure you have a AWS Amplify account. If you don't have one yet, you can create one for free at [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

## 1. Create a new project
After creating an account, you should see a prompt on the dashboard to create a new site from a Git repository. Click on the **Import from Git** button.


## 2.Select your repository 
If not already done, you will be asked to connect your Git provider account. After that, you can select the repository you want to deploy.

## 3.Create configuration file

To deploy your SuperStarter app to AWS Amplify, you need to create a config file. This file will contain the necessary information to connect your repository to AWS Amplify and deploy your application.

Let's create a new file called amplify.yml in the root of your project:
```yml amplify.yml
version: 1
applications:
  - frontend:
      buildPath: "/"
      phases:
        preBuild:
          commands:
            - npm install -g pnpm
            - pnpm install
        build:
          commands:
            - pnpm --filter web build
      artifacts:
        baseDirectory: apps/web/.next
        files:
          - "**/*"
      cache:
        paths:
          - node_modules/**/*
          - apps/web/.next/cache/**/*
    appRoot: apps/web
```

## 4. Define the environment variables
Now define the environment variables for your application. You can copy them from your .env.local file

## 5. Deploy the site
Now click on the Deploy site button and wait for the deployment to finish. After that, you should be able to visit your freshly deployed SaaS.
